ðŸ¤– Hi, Iâ€™m @muhammadmoosakhan â€” a final-year AI undergraduate at SZABIST with a strong passion for robotics, machine learning, deep learning, and computer vision. I enjoy building intelligent systems and am currently sharpening my skills through DeepLearning.ai courses. I'm open to collaborating on impactful Python-based AI/ML projects. When I'm not coding, youâ€™ll find me jamming on my guitar or turning ideas into real-world experiences. Connect with me on LinkedIn: linkedin.com/in/muhammad-moosa-khan/
