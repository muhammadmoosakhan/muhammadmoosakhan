👋 Hi, I’m @muhammadmoosakhan
👀 I’m interested in robotics, machine learning, deep learning, and artificial intelligence as my core BS is in artificial intelligence.
🌱 I’m currently learning Node.js, React.js, and JavaScript, and I'm doing DeepLearning.ai courses on Coursera to enhance my skills.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Python AI-based projects and creating a form assigning system for a bank.

😄 Pronouns: creative, versatile, humble, approachable
⚡ Fun fact: Being both an introvert and an extrovert, I have the unique ability to draw energy from both solitude and social interactions.
This makes me adaptable in various situations, whether I'm coding alone, playing my guitar for an audience, or sharing my culinary creations
with friends and family.
